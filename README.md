- 👋 Hi, I’m @manudas, but you can call me Manu :)
- 👀 I’m mainly interested in Android development with Kotlin... and maybe with other languages...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin and Elixir :D
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source Android application that has room for me, better if you use Kotlin
- 📫 How to reach me ... That's easy!! Drop me a message at cibermanu at hotmail dot com :)
